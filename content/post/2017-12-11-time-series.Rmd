Time series are similar to scatter plots in that you can have dots on the graph, but we mostly look at the line showing the trend of data.

```{r}
query<- "SELECT yearID, HR
FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"
result<-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Ruth's Home Runs of the Years")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Home Runs")
```
